CHILDREN SCREEN TIME REPORT

This project offers a simulated dataset on screen time patterns of 9,712 Indian children (8-18 years old), incorporating real-world trends and studies from 2023-2024. It provides a comprehensive view across urban and rural demographics, accounting for disparities in device access and screen habits. The dataset meticulously breaks down screen time by age, gender, primary device used (e.g., smartphone, TV), and the split between educational and recreational purposes. A critical aspect is its assessment of whether screen time exceeds Indian Academy of Pediatrics (IAP) guidelines, which is crucial given the documented surge in screen exposure post-COVID-19. The motivation for this project stems from concerning statistics: adolescents average 4-5 hours/day on screens, over 70% exceed recommended limits, and 83% of rural teens report excessive usage. Consequently, the dataset also explores the likely health impacts, including poor sleep, eye strain, and anxiety, providing valuable insights for public health initiatives and policy development.
